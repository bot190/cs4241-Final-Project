A Network Usage Visualizer aimed at exploring network usage from switches and routers.

This application is intended to connect to a variety of data sources and provide a visualization of network traffic. 
It focuses on visualizing the traffic on individual ports of network switches as well as the connections between 
switches and routers.

This demo version uses streams of random data to represent the graphs. On a network that you had admin rights to,
you could chart your actual network usage.

Users can log in and logout, and are required to login to access anything beyond the demo page.
Users can add their own switches, with a variable number of ports, and set which ports they have access to.
Users can then view visualizations of these ports on these switches on the main page.
